	This project is about the "Online Hospital Reservation System". As you may see, now a days people are focusing on, to get things done quickly, therefore this online reservation system helps to save time at the hospital, waiting for their turn to meet the doctor.
	
	This reservation system works only before the hospital opening timings, that is before 9am everyday(including sundays), from 6am to 9am.

	Here there is an admin, who has the power to add doctors, removing the doctors, seeing the doctors record, seeing the patients record.

	Then, the doctors, this hospitals have three types of doctors (1)Specialist Doctors, (2)MBBS/Normal Doctors and (3)Nurse Doctors.
All doctors have same powers like viewing all the patients, viewing only there patients. but the "Specialist Doctor" have the power to edit the patients conditions, which the patients enter while making an appointment.

	Comming to the conditions of the patients. Here we can see patients with 3 types of conditions
		1. Normal patients                       : These patients get only 15 mins to interact with the Specialists, which is more than sufficient.
		2. Not a Emergency but some what serious : These patients also get only 15 mins to interact with the Specialists, but they get "one" MBBS/NORMAL doctors support(The name of 							           the doctor will be displayed during the appointment reservation) for half a day, to get rid of their problems.
		3.Critical/Highly Emergency              : They also get the same benifits as tha patients whose condition is (2), along with this one they get a Nurse Support (The name of 							           the doctor will be displayed during the appointment reservation) for a "entire day", to solve the patients issue.

	There for paitent with condition 1 (- mentioned in the above list) will be treated by only Specialist Doctor,
					 2 (- mentioned in the above list) will be getting treatment by Specialist for 15mins and also by MBBS doctor for half a day,
                                         3 (- mentioned in the above list) will be getting treatment by Specialist for 15mins, by MBBS doctor for half a day and by the nurse for a complete 									           day 


	The patients also have there own power of checking their name in the appointment system, getting their token number, to check their doctors name and the time of their appointment, to make an appointment for the doctor of their own interest.



Since "Online Hospital Reservation System" application is not dedicated to a perticular hospital, this can be deployed by any hospitals with some upgradation to this software.
